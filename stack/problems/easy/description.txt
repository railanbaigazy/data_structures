Easy Problem:
Parenthesis Matching

Given a string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. 

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets are closed immediately.
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Examples:

Input: "()"
Output: true

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: "(]"
Output: false

_Notes_
C++:
If you're using g++ compiler, to avoid compilation warnings or errors - use this code in your terminal to compile the program:

g++ -std=c++11 solution.cpp

Change 'solution.cpp' to your file's name 


JS:
You can do all code either with HTML page or Node.js
You can get inputs with 'prompt()' function
You can output the answer either with 'console.log()' or 'alert()'
