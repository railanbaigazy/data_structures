Medium Problem:
Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

Given a list of arithmetic expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation), evaluate the expressions and return the result. 
The input expression consists of operands and operators, where operators include '+', '-', '*', and '/'. 
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Examples:

Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Output: 9

Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
Output: 6


_Notes_
C++:
If you're using g++ compiler, to avoid compilation warnings or errors - use this code in your terminal to compile the program:

g++ -std=c++11 solution.cpp

Change 'solution.cpp' to your file's name 


JS:
You can do all code either with HTML page or Node.js
You can get inputs with 'prompt()' function
You can output the answer either with 'console.log()' or 'alert()'
